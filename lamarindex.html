        <p class="twop">2005</p>
        
        <p class="onep">In 2004, Kendrick's first album "Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year)" was made. This was his first studio album, after this album debued, he wasn't really deemed a "rapper" because of that album. </p>

        <p class="twop">2011</p>
        <p class="onep">In 2011, Section 8.0 was made. In my opinion, one of Kendricks' best albums of his career, checkout the "Samples" for a sample of "Hol up". One of my favorites.</p>

        <p class="twop">2015</p>
        <p class="onep">This year Kendrick sort of opens up to his fans, most of his songs refer to his depression. Which he keeps secret for most of his career. An example of this would be "U" where he finds himself screaming in a hotel room. But, a song called "Alright" is basically contrasting "U". It's Kendrick realizing that he's more than just a rapper.</p>

        <p class="twop">2018+</p>
        <p class"onep">At this point in time, Kendrick created DAMN. His most controversial album, he's gotten a few awards for this album. And he was seen on POWER. </p>
